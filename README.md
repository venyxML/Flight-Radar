<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How to Install

1. Download the appropriate .jar file for your version and place in your server's plugins folder 
2. Run your Spigot server

Yeah this one doesn't really have a lot of extra steps so that's cool :)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## In-Game Usage

```/fr start <lat> <long>```
Starts looking for planes. Latitude and longitude need to be in decimal format. To represent S and W, use negative coordinates where appropriate.

For example, Poo Poo Point in Washington would be 47.4995 -122.0086.

```/fr stop```
It stops the plugin from constantly pinging the API. Please turn it off for your poor server's sake when you don't want to use it anymore.

Sometimes I might double report planes. I tried to work around this, but if it happens and it's annoying, please just ping me and I can give it a second thought.
